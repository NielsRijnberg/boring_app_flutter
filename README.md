# boring_app_flutter

A boring Flutter app which uses the Bored API to find activities to do. You can search for activities, filter them and as an addition save them to your favourites.

## The 3 levels of the Boring app

- Level 1: Made the activity screen to fetch a random activity to do including all UI parts when you click the button.

- Level 2: Made a separate screen to fetch a random activity based on a chosen type. Choose a type from the dropdown menu and you will get an activity from that type.

- Level 3: Added favourites to the app, like activities from anywhere in the app to save them to your favourites so you can see them later on. Remove the favourites in the favourites screen by clicking the heart again.

## Challenges
I challenged myself to make a decent UI for the app. I used the colors and how for example buttons look like exactly the same as DCC does on the website. I also tried to split up the code in separate folders so that it would be structured nicely. I have a "models" folder for all the models that are needed within the app. The service to fetch data from the API is in a "service" folder. The different screens are in a "screens" folder, and they are using al kinds of self-made widgets, which are in the "widget" folder.
Working with Flutter was really nice, and worked out well. To start on learning Flutter and making this sample app was relatively easy for me (because I have experience with a lot of other mobile frameworks like Swift, Kotlin, Java and React-native). I spent around 6 hours developping the app, including reading documentation and watching tutorials for several subjects.

## Run the app
- Clone the app from this Gitrepo (https://github.com/NielsRijnberg/boring_app_flutter.git)
- Open the repo in your favourite IDE and make sure the Flutter plugins are installed
- Build and run the app
